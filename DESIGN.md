# Design

orx's terminal UI. It borrows rra's rules (dark, quiet, one accent, hierarchy from brightness rather than hue) and translates them to a character grid. Colors live in `src/tui/theme.ts`, the only file under `src/tui/` allowed to hold color literals (the Grit plugin flags hex strings anywhere else). This file says what each role is for. Read it before a visual change, and load the `tui-design-slop` skill before adding a panel, border, header, badge, spinner, or empty state.

## Theme

The terminal's own background shows through: orx never paints a full-screen fill, so it looks right in light and dark terminal themes as far as a fixed palette can. The palette assumes a dark background, the common case; text roles are chosen to stay readable on a light one.

## Color roles

| Role | Token | Use for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Text | `theme.text` | Assistant replies |
| User | `theme.user` | The user's messages, prefixed `> ` |
| Muted | `theme.muted` | The model id in the header, placeholders, the empty-state line |
| Faint | `theme.faint` | Usage lines, key hints, the chat id: present but out of the way |
| Accent | `theme.accent` | The `orx` wordmark and the picker's border. One job per screen |
| Tool | `theme.tool` | Tool call lines (`→ currentTime({...})`) |
| Error | `theme.error` | The error line under a reply, and nothing else |
| Border | `theme.border` | The composer frame (`theme.faint` while a reply streams), and the picker's selected row |
| Selected | `theme.selectedBg` | The picker's background, so it reads as a layer over the chat |

## Layout

Top to bottom: a one-row header (`orx`, the model, the short chat id right-aligned), the message list (fills the rest, sticks to the bottom while a reply streams), the composer (a bordered one-line input), and a one-row footer with key hints or a status message such as "Exported to orx-chat-0f0e0d0c.md". Every fixed row has `flexShrink={0}` so a long thread can't squeeze them.

Messages are separated by one blank row. A reply is its tool lines, then its text, then an error line if it failed, then its usage line (`model · 278 in / 30 out · $0.000057`). No boxes around messages, no avatars, no timestamps.

The model picker and the command list share one overlay (`src/tui/picker.tsx`), inset from the edges, with a search input and a list (the command list shows each description under its name). It's the only bordered panel besides the composer.

Slash command output (`/help`, an unknown command or mode) is a few unbordered lines between the messages and the composer, `muted` (or `error`), until the next message or Esc. A permission mode other than `default` shows right-aligned in the footer, `muted`.

## Keys

| Key | Does |
| --- | --- |
| Enter | Send the message, or run a `/command` |
| / | In an empty composer, open the command list (built-ins, custom commands, skills) |
| Esc | Stop the streaming reply (it's saved, marked interrupted), close a list, or dismiss the /help or error lines |
| Ctrl+P | Open the model picker (not while a reply streams) |
| Ctrl+E | Export the chat as Markdown into the current directory |
| Ctrl+C | Quit, stopping a reply first so it's saved; exit code 0 |

The footer always lists these. A new key goes in the footer, this table, and `app.tsx`'s docblock in the same change. Don't bind keys terminals commonly swallow (Ctrl+S, Ctrl+Q, Ctrl+Z). Ctrl+E takes over the input's end-of-line shortcut; the input is one line, so End does the same job.

## States

- Empty chat: one muted line saying how to send and pick a model (the footer lists the rest). No banner, no ASCII art.
- Streaming: the reply shows `…` until the first text arrives; the composer's placeholder says "Replying… Esc stops" and its border goes faint.
- Error: the partial reply stays, with the error line under it. A retryable error says "(send again to retry)"; a non-retryable one (a rejected key) says only what happened.
- Models list unavailable: the picker says so in the error color, and Esc closes it; chat keeps the current model.

## Do and don't

- Do let the terminal's background and font do the work. Don't draw full-width bars, gradients, or box-drawing frames around content.
- Do keep one accent job per screen. Don't color labels, counts, and borders in the accent at once.
- Do show numbers plainly (`12 in / 5 out`, `$0.000420`). Don't add spinners that move while nothing is happening; the streaming text is the progress indicator.
- Don't write to stdout or stderr while the TUI runs: logs go to the log file only (`TerminalLogging` is off).
